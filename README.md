## 👋 Hello, visitor! May The Force be with you!



I'm a 41 year old Electronic Engineer from São Paulo, Brazil and I'm studying to become a Full Stack Developer at Rocketseat School. I'm currently looking for opportunities. I love to learn and contribute in any and every possible way. I'm passionate about technology, people, theater and specially movies, as well as you've been noticed, I'm a huge fan of Star Wars.
